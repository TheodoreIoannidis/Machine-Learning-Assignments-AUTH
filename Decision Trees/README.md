# Assignment on Decsion Trees. 

In the first part, we use scikit learn's breast cancer dataset in order to compare the performance (metric= f1 score) of the decision tree classifier for different values of the max_depth parameter.

In the second part we are asked to use the data from the income.csv files (which is a modified version of the Adult Income dataset) and build a pipeline which handles the preprocessing of the data and uses a Decision Tree classifier.

Finally, we are asked to perform grid search in order to find the best parameters for the pipeline.
