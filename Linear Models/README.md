# Assignment on Linear Models

In this assignment, after a relatively small introduction to Numpy and Pandas, we are asked to build a Logistic Regression model from scratch.

Later, we are asked to modify the code we wrote and create a Class containing all the neccessary functions to train a Logistic Regression model and make predictions.

Towards the end we also add the option to run with L1 and L2 reguralization.
